# EtsyLabelMaker
A simple address label maker for helping my brother's Etsy shop.

This program allows the user to place several multiline mailing addresses on a single page for printing.
Originally, this was created with thermal printer labels in mind.

Enter a shipping address in the text box. If you want to add another address, click the Add button and the program will hold on the previous address and clear the text box for your next address.

Click the Save button to save the label as a png image.
